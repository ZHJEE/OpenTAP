----- TAP 2018 ----------------------------------------------------------------

--- Prerequisites
 - Ubuntu (16.04)
 - .NET Core 2.0
   To install follow instructions here:
   https://www.microsoft.com/net/learn/get-started/linuxubuntu

--- Automatic installation
 - Run the command "sh INSTALL.sh"

--- Manual installation
 - Unzip the TAPLinux.TapPackage file. This is a normal ZIP file.
 - Set directory permission as being read-write in the TAP directory. This is
   needed for package installation and session log output.

--- Usage
The two main executables are "Keysight.Tap.Cli" and
"Keysight.Tap.PackageManager". If you ran the automatic install script
these should be callable straight away. Otherwise you should call:
"dotnet Keysight.Tap.Cli.dll <arguments>"

--- Licensing
To use TAP on Linux you need to have a running FlexLM license server with
KS8400A/KS8000A license(s) installed. This can be set up using the Keysight
FLO tool.

In Linux you should set the LM_LICENSE_FILE environment variable like you
would on a Windows machine.

You could for example add something like `export LM_LICENSE_FILE=@Hostname`
to your .bash_rc file.
