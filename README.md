# OpenTAP

OpenTAP is an Open Source project for fast and easy development and execution of automated tests. 
OpenTAP is built with simplicity, scalability and speed in mind and is based on an extendable architecture that leverage .NET Core. 
OpenTAP offers a range of sequencing functionality and infrastructure that makes it possible for you to quickly develop plugins tailored for your automation needs – plugins that can be shared with the OpenTAP community throught the OpenTAP package repository. 

## Getting OpenTAP

If you are looking to use OpenTAP, you can get pre-built binaries at http://opentap.io. 

Using the OpenTAP CLI you are now able to download plugin packages from the OpenTAP package repository.

To list and install plugin packages do the following in the command prompt: 
`cd %TAP_PATH` 
`tap package list` 

We recommend that you download the Software Development Kit, or simply the Developer’s System Community Edition provided by Keysight Technologies. The Developer System is a bundle that contain the SDK as well as a graphical user interface and result viewing capabilities. It can be installed by typing the following `tap package install 'Developer's System CE'`
