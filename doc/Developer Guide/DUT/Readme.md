DUT
===
To develop a *device under test* (DUT) plugin, extend (or inherit from) the **DUT** class, which itself extends the **Resource** class. The *Open* and *Close* methods MUST be implemented:

-	The **Open** method is called before the test plan starts, and must execute successfully. The Open method should include any code necessary to configure the DUT prior to testing. All open methods on all classes that extend Resource are called in parallel, and prior to any use of the DUT in a test step.
-	The **Close** method is called after the test plan is done. The Close method should include any code necessary to configure the DUT to a safe condition after testing. The Close method will also be called if testing is halted early. All close methods are called in parallel, and after any use of the DUT in a test step. 

The DUT template generated by the Visual Studio class wizard includes minimal implementations of these calls. 

Developers should add appropriate properties and methods to the plugin code to allow:

-	Configuration of the DUT during setup. The DUT base class already has defined string properties for **ID** and **Comment**.
-	Control of the DUT during the execution of test steps.
