Introduction
============
This document describes the programmatic interface to Keysight's **Test Automation on PathWave** (TAP) and shows how to get started using TAP for implementing test steps, instrument plugins, DUT plugins and result listeners. 

## Audience
This document is written for **C# programmers** who are developing TAP plugins or integrating TAP into their own applications. It is not a reference manual, but rather a document that describes the principles behind TAP and how to use its most important features from a programmer's perspective. Other documents cover an introduction to the TAP GUIs.

## TAP SDK
TAP includes a Software Development Kit (SDK). The SDK includes Microsoft Visual Studio 2015/2017 extensions that provide code templates for creating TAP plugins. To install it, select the SDK option during TAP installation.

## Prerequisites
Before reading this document, you should be familiar with the usage of TAP from the TAP GUI. Refer to the *TAP Graphical User Interface Help* documentation accessible from the TAP GUI by pressing F1 or via the Keysight websites.

Development requires the following software:

- Visual Studio 2015 or 2017
- TAP, including the SDK
- TAP license
