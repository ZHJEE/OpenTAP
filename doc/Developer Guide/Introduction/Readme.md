Introduction
============
This document describes the programmatic interface to Keysight's **Test Automation** (OpenTAP) and shows how to get started using OpenTAP for implementing test steps, instrument plugins, DUT plugins and result listeners. 

## Audience
This document is written for **C# programmers** who are developing OpenTAP plugins or integrating OpenTAP into their own applications. It is not a reference manual, but rather a document that describes the principles behind OpenTAP and how to use its most important features from a programmer's perspective. Other documents cover an introduction to the OpenTAP GUIs.

## Keysight OpenTAP SDK
OpenTAP includes a Software Development Kit (SDK). The SDK includes Microsoft Visual Studio 2015/2017 extensions that provide code templates for creating OpenTAP plugins. To install it, select the SDK option during OpenTAP installation.

## Prerequisites
Before reading this document, you should be familiar with the usage of OpenTAP from the OpenTAP GUI. Refer to the *OpenTAP Graphical User Interface Help* documentation accessible from the OpenTAP GUI by pressing F1 or via the Keysight websites.

Development requires the following software:

- Visual Studio 2015 or 2017
- Keysight Test Automation Developer's System including the SDK
