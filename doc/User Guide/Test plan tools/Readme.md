# Test Plan Tools

As you may have noticed, a test plan consists simply of XML. This language is easy for machines to read, but, unfortunately, horrible for humans to write. You *could* modify and extend test plans by hand, but we recommend using the tools we have developed.

You currently have two options:
1. [Developer’s System Community Edition](https://www.opentap.io/download.html) - mature, feature-rich GUI (recommended)
2. [OpenTAP-TUI](https://gitlab.com/OpenTAP/Plugins/opentap-tui/opentap-tui) - open source cross-platform text-based user interface for usage in terminals (beta)
