# Test plan tools

As you may have noticed, a test plan consists simply of neatly structured XML. This language is easy for machines to read, but unfortunately, horrible for humans to write. You *could* modify and extend test plans by hand, but we recommend using the tools we have developed.

You currently have two options:
1. [Pathwave](findurl) - paid - full featured GUI
2. [OpenTAP-TUI](https://gitlab.com/OpenTAP/Plugins/opentap-tui/opentap-tui) - free - cross-platform text-based user interface for usage in terminals
