# Introduction

This document assumes familiarity with the concept of test plans. If you are not sure what a test plan is, fret not! Take a look at this [introduction to test plans](reference) and come back here.

Although this chapter primarily targets users, developers will likely find it helpful as well. The purpose of this document is twofold; first, to familiarize you with the built-in features of the OpenTAP CLI, and get started installing Keysight- and community developed plugins. Second, to introduce you to useful tools in constructing and managing test plans. 

Since a large chunk of the value of OpenTAP as a test automation platform comes from its extensibility through plugins, the application itself only ships with a few essential components:

1. the capability to execute test plans;
2. a package manager to browse and install plugins.

We will address these two points in the [next chapter](../CLI%20Usage).
