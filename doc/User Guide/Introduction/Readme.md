# Introduction

This section is a concise introduction to essential OpenTAP terminology, concepts, and tools.
It is intended for users as well as developers to get comfortable with the command line interface, and tools for 
editing test plans. This section of the guide is for anyone. The only real requirement is that you have installed OpenTAP.

If you are already familiar with test plans, DUTs, and instruments, feel free to skip the OpenTAP Overview portion.

If you are just looking for a quick reference of CLI options, a comprehensive reference of builtin commands is available [here](../CLI%20Reference).
