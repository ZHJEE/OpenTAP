# Overview
This section is a concise introduction to essential OpenTAP terminology, concepts, and tools at a cursory level. The intention is that it should provide non-developers with a sufficient understanding of OpenTAP and its ecosystem to get started,
We will go into much more technical detail in the Developer's Guide section.
If you are just looking for a quick reference of CLI options, a comprehensive reference of builtin commands is available [here](../CLI%20Reference).
